# TypeScript Template Repo

This is a template repository for building TypeScript projects.

It comes pre-configured with:

- TypeScript
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Scripts for building, starting, linting, and formatting

It does not have a `yarn.lock` file, so the first time you install dependencies, one will be created.
